# Description

This is a little front-end design to attempt to clone We-transfer's landing page. The process involved mobile responsiveness, working with cards and also inserting favicon on the title bar on the browser. HTML and CSS were used in this project. I faced a challenge on removing the background from the logo image. The background of the logo image wasn't removed, moreover, i found out of remove.bg a resouce or a webpage where one can upload pictures and remove the image  background.
